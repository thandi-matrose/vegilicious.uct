                You've just picked up
                THE CONSCIOUS PLATE,<br />
                a newsletter about food and the ways it shapes our livesâ€”written by students, for students.

                THE CONSCIOUS PLATE is about eating with awarenessâ€”of taste, of history, and of the world we want to
                build.

                <h4>
                    RE: The Crisis at UCT <br/>
                </h4>
                <p><br/>We, as Vegilicious, would like to express our solidarity with the efforts made
                    by the SRC and various faculty councils to address the Housing Crisis and Fee Blocks present for
                    many students at UCT. The demands made, we find, are entirely reasonable and the lack of cooperation
                    by UCT Executive is profoundly disappointing to say the least. <br/><br/>To be denied housing is to be denied
                    a basic recognition of humanity. As a society, we aim to make it easier for students to be more
                    conscientious about what we eat but, whatâ€™s happening right in front of our eyes, what the crisis at
                    UCT has resulted in, is our fellow students being denied registration and housing, they do not have
                   <em>mere access</em> to food, among many other basic necessities.<br/> The reality of this is disturbing.<br/> <br/>We
                    concur with the SRC in that these issues have been and are historic, recurring and, after years upon
                    years, unsurprising. This fact should fill every person with indignation.<br/> We, as Vegilicious, urge
                    all of our society members to keep themselves and their communities informed. <strong>Care</strong> for the
                    environment, care for animals, care for your body, care for your spirit: these are the reasons we
                    are vegan, vegetarian, plant-based or follow religious dietary requirements, and so we implore you
                    to follow your convictions and participate in restoring dignity to our fellow students. <br/> <br></p> <h3 style="color:var(--dark-colour)"> Lift Fee

                            to mingle and enjoy some vegan snacks togetherðŸ’š<br />
